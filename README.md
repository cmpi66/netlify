[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7d00605d-360e-40b0-9125-d32fbb1a817c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elaborate-sprite-b67a31/deploys)
## How it works

You can go [here](https://www.munozpi.com/blog/about-this-site/) to see how I built this site.

I deploy my website to netlify so a netlify.toml handles the automatic deployment every time I push to the `main branch`.

I use a makefile so I won't have to remember a lot of commands. The makefile updates Hugo, my theme and installs any dependencies.
