Munozpi.com is created by me Chris Munoz. I do all the writing, research, code, and everything else you see here.

## Hugo

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a fantastic static site generator. It's relatively easy to get started with and it has great documentation.

Everything I use is [open source](https://github.com/cmpi66/netlify.git).

## Theme 

The theme is based on the bootstrap module, you can find it [here](https://github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap). It has almost everything you need in a website. Searching also comes with the theme so no need to add it in yourself.

## Tools

I deploy my site to Netlify. I have a config file that updates my site every time I make a push to my `main` branch. I use a [make file](https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-self-documenting-makefile/) that I tweaked from [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I use her python based [link checker](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hydra-link-checker) to check for any broken links.

Aside from creating the content, maintaining a static site requires minimal effort. The best part is that you can edit your site locally with your favorite text editor.
