# color schemes


This is an artile that I'm thinking about adding on color schemes and how they make you productive. Not sure though. It is true that they are helpful, but I'm leaning on Primagens argument, on function over beauty. We'll see. Either way this is like a filler article, it doesn't hold nearly as much weight as the other ones, so even if I do do it, it'll be later.
